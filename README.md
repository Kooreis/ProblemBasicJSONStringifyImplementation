# Question: How do you implement a basic JSON.stringify function? JavaScript Summary

The provided JavaScript code is a simple implementation of the JSON.stringify function. The function, named jsonStringify, takes an object as an argument and converts it into a JSON string. It first checks the type of the object. If the object is not an object type or is null, it checks if it's a string, undefined, or function type. If it is, it adds double quotes around it and converts it into a string. If the object is an object type, it creates an empty array to store the JSON string. It then checks if the object is an array. It iterates over the object and for each key-value pair, it checks the type of the value. If the value is a string, undefined, or function type, it adds double quotes around it. If the value is an object type and not null, it recursively calls the jsonStringify function. It then pushes the key-value pair into the array, with the key and value separated by a colon. If the object is an array, it returns the JSON string enclosed in square brackets, otherwise, it returns the JSON string enclosed in curly braces. This implementation, however, does not handle all the edge cases that the real JSON.stringify function does.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is more structured and uses TypeScript's static typing feature to ensure type safety. The `stringify` method in the TypeScript version is declared to take any type of value and return a string. This makes it clear what types of values the function can handle and what type it returns.

The TypeScript version uses a switch statement instead of multiple if-else statements, which makes the code cleaner and easier to read. It also uses the `Array.isArray` method to check if an object is an array, which is more reliable than checking the constructor property as in the JavaScript version.

The TypeScript version also uses the `hasOwnProperty` method to ensure that only the object's own properties are included in the string representation, not properties inherited from the prototype chain. This is a good practice to avoid unexpected behavior.

The TypeScript version uses template literals (backticks) to build strings, which is a more modern and readable way to concatenate strings than using the plus operator as in the JavaScript version.

Finally, the TypeScript version is wrapped in a class, which makes it more modular and reusable. The JavaScript version is just a standalone function. This difference is more about coding style and organization than about the functionality of the code itself.

# C++ Differences

The JavaScript version of the solution manually implements the JSON.stringify function. It checks the type of the input object and handles each type differently. If the input is not an object or is null, it converts it to a string. If the input is an object, it iterates over the object's properties and converts each one to a string, recursively calling the jsonStringify function for nested objects. It also handles arrays differently from other objects, adding square brackets instead of curly braces.

The C++ version, on the other hand, uses the nlohmann/json library to handle JSON data. This library provides a function called `dump` that converts a JSON object to a string, which is equivalent to the JSON.stringify function in JavaScript. This version does not need to manually handle different types of data or iterate over the object's properties, as the library handles all of this internally.

The main difference between the two versions is that the JavaScript version manually implements the functionality, while the C++ version uses a library. This means that the JavaScript version needs to handle all the edge cases and data types, while the C++ version can rely on the library to do this. The C++ version is also shorter and easier to read, but it requires the nlohmann/json library to be installed.

In terms of language features, the JavaScript version uses regular expressions to check the type of the input, while the C++ version uses the type system provided by the nlohmann/json library. The JavaScript version also uses the `constructor` property to check if the input is an array, while the C++ version does not need to do this as the library handles arrays automatically.
